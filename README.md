In this repository, you'll find a growing number of scripts designed to help with common operations one might care to do with Zendo, the Zendo inference API for their task, and more!
You might also find that, overtime, this is a shrinking number of scripts as any of these operations are liable to be turned into core functionality of [Zendo - an A.I. agent that anyone can teach visual recognition tasks.](https://deepai.org/zendo)
